# Components


## Desktop, panel and quick settings

![Desktop](../assets/screenshot/201215/desktoppanels.png)

The desktop is the location of windows, widgets (planned), and the wallpaper.

The panel is the hub for application launching and managing settings.

Quick settings assists in changing relevant system settings quickly (hence the name), offering an easier and more efficient method of changing settings than opening the app.

## Launcher

![launcher](../assets/screenshot/201215/launcher.png)

The launcher is for opening and viewing a grid of every application in the system, as well as a list of quick, helpful cards that display notifications and information. 

A search bar is also available to sort through apps, find settings, and search the web. 

# Development

## TL;DR for Linux

```bash
flutter channel master # Set flutter to master channel
flutter upgrade # Upgrade to master channel
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop # Add Linux as a target
git clone https://github.com/dahliaos/pangolin-desktop pangolin_desktop # Clone the repo
cd pangolin_desktop
flutter create . # Optional, but updates the embedder code
flutter run -d linux
```

# Developing Pangolin for dahliaOS Linux-Based builds

While pre-compiled builds can be found in the dahliaOS-overlays folder, you can also compile Pangolin and include them in the Buildroot toolchain.

## Prerequisites

To develop for dahliaOS Linux-Based, you will need the `flutter` tool, and a compiled base config from dahliaos/buildroot. 

Compiling the base config will take about 6 hours. 

Once finished, copy the dahliaOS overlays into the buildroot/output/target directory, and then go to the pangolin_desktop directory. 

Open up a terminal, and type `flutter build linux --release` to generate a release build. 

Copy the output bundle files (located under build/release/) to `buildroot/output/target/dahlia/pangolin`, and compile the image file again to include it.
